Create a webpage that reads the json from this URL:
https://richardeigenmann.github.io/Rezeptsammlung/recipesArray.json
The json is an array of recipes with this format:
[
  {
    "filename": "Rcp001.htm",
    "name": "Beeren-Tiramisu",
    "imageFilename": "Rcp001.jpg",
    "width": "400",
    "height": "294",
    "categories": {
      "Speise-Kategorie": [
        "Desserts",
        "Vegetarisch"
      ],
      "Zutat": [
        "L&ouml;ffelbiskuits",
        "QimiQ",
        "Milch",
        "Mascarpone",
        "Zitronen",
        "Vollrahm",
        "Zucker",
        "Mandelsplitter"
      ],
      "Bewertung": [
        "4 Sterne"
      ],
      "Quelle": [
        "Lilian Stross"
      ]
    },
    "stars": "4"
  }]

When loading the JSON, fix all the HTML escaping in the strings so we don't have to
bother with the escape sequences later. 

Create a distinct and sorted list of the "Zutat" elements.

Show the distinct list of Ingredients in a table. Remember that the texts are in HTML Escaped mode. 
Fix that. Add two columns for a checkbox each.
The first checkbox column indicates that the user wants to use this ingredient.
The second checkbox column indicates that the ingredient is available in the kitchen.

The user should be able to tick the ingredients and the state of both checkboxes should
be stored in the browser's local storage and should be retrieved the next time the page is opened.
The user should not have to reselect the available ingredients from last time.

When the user clicks on a search button the app should visit each recipe and count the number of 
kitchen ingredients that match the recipe requirements (matchCount) and also count the number of 
missing ingredients for the recipe (missingCount). We also want to know a matchUseCount for 
the ingredients indicated in the use list from the additional checkbox.

The recipes should then be shown in bootstrap-table-multiple-sort. Pagination of 100 is default.
First column has the picture and the recipe name.
The image is found on the same base url 
followed by the "imageFilename". Make the images fit into a box of 150 px wide and 100 tall 
while maintaining the aspect ratio.

Next is the matchUseCount.
Next is matchCount.
Next is missingCount.
In the final column is the list of use matching ingredients in the first line.
Next line is the matching ingredients in the kitchen
The last line shows the list of missing ingredients.
The recipe is found on the base url https://richardeigenmann.github.io/Rezeptsammlung/ with 
the "filename" from the JSON.

Use bootstrap 5 for the styling of the page.
Keep the html and javascript all in one page for easy copy/pasting.
Make it so that I can paste the result into a Angular 19 component.html file
